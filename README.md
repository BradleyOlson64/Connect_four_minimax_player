# Connect_four_minimax_player
This code contains a connect four game framework allowing a human to play with an AI connect four player via graphical interface. The AI player uses the minimax algorithm using possible states after the next few turns to make its decisions. The depth of the minimax analysis can be adjusted, making the AI player exponentially slower but much harder to beat.
